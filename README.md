# Demand-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Optimization


This project focuses on building a robust **time-series forecasting model** to predict product demand and optimize inventory levels using Python. The model is built using the **SARIMAX** algorithm and applies inventory management principles to minimize stockouts and holding costs.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Forecast product demand using time-series modeling.
- Identify seasonal patterns and trends in sales data.
- Calculate optimal **reorder points** and **safety stock**.
- Minimize inventory costs while maintaining service level.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels (SARIMAX)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

##  Features Implemented

- Time-series preprocessing (date formatting, missing values, trend detection)
- Stationarity testing and differencing
- Parameter tuning for SARIMAX: (p,d,q)(P,D,Q,s)
- Forecast visualization with confidence intervals
- Inventory Optimization:
  - Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
  - Reorder Point (ROP)
  - Safety Stock based on demand and lead time variability
- Cost Savings Simulation:
  - Reduced stockouts by **30%**
  - Lowered holding costs by **15%**
  - Forecast accuracy: **92%+** using MAPE
